/**
 * The tripwire for the one thing this engine copies rather than derives.
 *
 * `messages.mjs` holds a hand-copy of `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`'
 * `meta.messages`, and `config.mjs` holds the list of its options, because this
 * project may import Node built-ins and `typescript` only — loading the plugin
 * would drag `@nx/devkit` and a project-graph read into a layer whose value is
 * being pure. A copy with no check is a copy that drifts, and the drift is
 * invisible: an id this engine spells one way and ESLint spells another makes a
 * differential comparison silently pass on ids neither tool emits.
 *
 * So this reads the INSTALLED plugin's source as text and compares. It is an
 * integration test by its filename because it reaches out of the project into
 * `node_modules`, and it is the test that should fail — loudly, naming the
 * message — the first time an Nx upgrade rewords a rule.
