# `src/rules/` — the boundary rules

`@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` reproduced over analysis records instead of an
ESLint AST, so the same **15 violation types** under the same **8 options**
reach Go, Rust, Python and Vue — the languages ESLint cannot read, where a
`layer:`/`scope:`/`license:` tag has no mechanism behind it today. Five of those
types are decided on the raw import specifier rather than on the project pair,
which is why the analysis record carries the specifier and its position and why
an Nx graph edge alone cannot serve them (`../analysis/contract.md`, "superset
of a graph edge").

One entry point:

```js
evaluate(importSites, graph, config) -> Violation[]
```

Pure: analysis records and the loaded config, nothing else — no filesystem, no
git, no Nx. A rule never reads a file, never resolves a specifier, and never
decides which files to visit; a rule that reaches for those turns into a second,
weaker analyzer. That purity is what lets the CLI and the language server share
one verdict, and what lets all fifteen rules be driven from fixtures with no
workspace at all.

| module             | what it owns                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.mjs`        | the pipeline, in upstream's order; `allow`; the `Violation` record      |
| `tags.mjs`         | only / not / empty-only, and which constraints a source is held to      |
| `topology.mjs`     | circular, self-circular, apps, e2e, buildable, lazy, transitive         |
| `specifiers.mjs`   | relative-across, relative-externals, banned and nested-banned externals |
| `messages.mjs`     | the fifteen message templates, copied verbatim from upstream            |
| `match.mjs`        | Nx's three pattern dialects — none of them minimatch                    |
| `reachability.mjs` | who reaches whom: the cycle check and the transitive tag check share it |

## Read these before changing anything here

Each is the opposite of the implementation a reader would write from the message
text alone, and each is marked at its call site.

1. **No matching constraint is an ERROR.** `findConstraintsFor` returning
   nothing means the source project's tags match no row, and upstream reports
   `projectWithoutTagsCannotHaveDependencies`. "No rule said no, so it's fine"
   inverts it, and every mis-tagged project escapes silently.
2. **Several matching constraints are AND.** The result is an array and the loop
   over it is a conjunction. A project on four tag axes is held to all four rows.
3. **`allow` matches the RAW SPECIFIER with Nx's own matcher**, whose fallback
   branch is an unanchored `new RegExp(entry)`. Not the file path, not
   minimatch. A glob library silently changes which escape hatches still work.
4. **The order is the semantics.** Upstream is a chain of `report(); return;`,
   so most sites yield at most one violation and which one depends on the order.
   Two places break that: the npm branch (transitive and banned are both
   reported) and the nested-banned check (one report per offending package).
5. **`bannedExternalImports` is checked in two unrelated places** — directly,
   for an npm target, before any tag rule runs; and nested, only under
   `checkNestedExternalImports`. An npm target returns before the tag block, so
   no external import can ever produce a no-constraint violation.

## Where this engine is deliberately stricter than ESLint

The dangerous failure is a false NEGATIVE — reporting clean while a violation
exists. That is worse than today, where ESLint is right about JS/TS and silent
elsewhere: silence you know about beats a green light you cannot trust. So every
judgement call resolves toward reporting. The ones that change a verdict:

- **Facts upstream reads off disk are optional graph fields, and absent means
  "the exemption does not apply"** — `data.mfeRemote` (`noImportsOfApps`),
  `data.entryPoints` (secondary entry points), `data.declaredPackages`
  (`noTransitiveDependencies`). An adapter that has them supplies them; one that
  does not gets the strict answer.
- **An external record with no external node in the graph is still checked.**
  `src/graph/` deliberately registers no crates, PyPI distributions or Go
  modules as external nodes, and upstream bails when it cannot find one — which
  would leave `bannedExternalImports` unenforceable outside JavaScript. The
  record's own answer is taken instead. The reach is narrower than it reads:
  upstream's locator also resolves `node_modules`, so the synthesis changes a
  verdict only where an analyzer names a package without needing it installed —
  Go, Rust and Python (`../conformance/README.md`). **A specifier that is a path
  gets no node, synthesized or otherwise**, because a package name is what the
  mechanism needs and a path is never one; `isPathSpecifier` in `index.mjs` is
  the same test the branch that reports `noRelativeOrAbsoluteExternals` uses, so
  a path refused a target is a path that gets reported.
- **`require()` and `require.resolve()` of a lazy-loaded library are reported**,
  where ESLint exempts both. The analysis contract records either call as
  `kind: "static"`, like an `import` statement, and the three cannot be told
  apart from the record.
- **An `ignoredCircularDependencies` pattern this engine cannot expand exactly
  is rejected at config load.** Nx expands them with minimatch, which this
  project may not import, and an ignore list that expands to almost the right set
  hides real cycles.

## What must not land here

- **A second copy of the constraint table.** The table has one home,
  `module-boundaries.config.mjs` at the workspace root, and `../config.mjs` is
  the only thing that reads it.
- **A workspace's specific project names, areas, or tag values.** This tool also
  runs inside the private control-plane workspace through a pinned harness
  clone, over a different tree with different names. Everything comes from the
  graph and the config — fixtures included.
- **Judgment about which files to analyze.** A rule is handed records.
- **A `messageId` upstream does not use.** The ids are what make a differential
  comparison against ESLint mean anything, and
  `upstream.integration.test.mjs` fails when a copied message or option drifts.
