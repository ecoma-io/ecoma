/**
 * The fifteen violation messages, and the renderer that fills them.
 *
 * Every string below is a verbatim copy of `meta.messages` in
 * `@nx/eslint-plugin`'s `enforce-module-boundaries` rule, and every key is that
 * rule's `messageId` spelled exactly. The ids are the contract: a differential
 * test can put this engine's verdict beside ESLint's for the same import and
 * compare ids, which is the only way to know the two agree rather than merely
 * both being red. `src/rules/upstream.integration.test.mjs` reads the installed
 * plugin's source and fails when a copy here drifts from it.
 *
 * Copied rather than imported, and rather than derived (Rule 14 rung 3): this
 * project may import Node built-ins and `typescript` only (project CLAUDE.md),
 * and importing the plugin would pull `@nx/devkit` — a project graph read — into
 * a layer whose whole point is being pure. The value is intrinsic to a fixed
 * external contract, it lives in exactly this one place, and the integration
 * test is what keeps the copy honest.
