/**
 * The graph layer: cross-project EDGES for Go, Rust, and Python, in the shape
 * Nx's `createDependencies` hook returns. Nothing else — nodes still come from
 * each project's hand-written `project.json`, and targets are never inferred
 * (root CLAUDE.md → Workspace Execution: project.json is the source of truth).
 *
 * This is the plugin half of the tool, and it is deliberately separate from
 * `../analysis/`. The two answer different questions over the same tree: the
 * graph asks "does project A depend on project B", which is all `nx affected`
 * can act on, while analysis asks "which import, written where, in what form" —
 * a superset a boundary rule needs and an Nx edge cannot carry
 * (`../analysis/contract.md`). Keeping them apart is what stops the graph from
 * growing fields Nx will drop and analysis from being trimmed to what Nx keeps.
 *
 * Each resolver reads tracked manifests and sources statically (regex for Go
 * imports, smol-toml for Cargo/uv manifests) so the graph computes without any
 * language toolchain installed. A workspace with no Go/Rust/Python projects
 * pays nothing: every resolver keys off `<projectRoot>/<manifest>` existing in
 * the project's tracked files.
 *
 * Resolver contract (kept identical across languages, see `../analysis/*.mjs`):
 *   resolve(projects, filesOf, readFile) -> [{ source, target, sourceFile, type }]
