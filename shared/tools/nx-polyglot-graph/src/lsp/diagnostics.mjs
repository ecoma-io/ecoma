/**
 * Analysis records and rule verdicts, rendered as LSP `Diagnostic` objects.
 *
 * ## The coordinate conversion is the whole reason this module exists
 *
 * The analysis contract is **1-based** in both axes, because that is what a
 * `file:line:column` terminal report wants (`../analysis/contract.md`). The
 * Language Server Protocol is **0-based** in both axes. One subtraction stands
 * between the two, and getting it wrong does not fail loudly: every diagnostic
 * still appears, one line above or below the import it is about, and every
 * developer who follows it edits the wrong line. So the conversion lives in one
 * exported function with its own tests rather than inline at three call sites.
 *
 * The column axis needs no re-encoding to go with the subtraction. The contract
 * counts UTF-16 code units from the start of the line (`../analysis/source-util.mjs`),
 * and `positionEncoding` defaults to `utf-16` in the protocol, so the two axes
 * already measure the same unit. A server that negotiated `utf-8` positions
 * would have to re-encode here; this one advertises none, which leaves the
 * default in force.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of diagnostic, and why the difference is visible in `code`
 *
 * A **violation** carries the upstream `messageId` as its `code`, which is what
 * lets a reader match this server's verdict against the one
 * `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` gives for the same import.
 *
 * A **failure** — a file that could not be parsed, read, or resolved — carries
 * `ANALYSIS_FAILURE_CODE`, deliberately not one of `MESSAGE_IDS`. The
 * distinction is the point: a consumer must be able to tell "a rule found
 * something" from "no rule could look", and a shared code would collapse them.

 * 2. **The width comes from the document, not from the record.** The analyzers
 *    point at the start of the written specifier — which for TypeScript and Go
 *    is the OPENING QUOTE and for Rust and Python is the first character of the
 *    path itself. Reading the character actually at the start settles which,
 *    instead of this module carrying a per-language table that would have to be
 *    updated with every new analyzer.
 * 3. **Everything is clamped to the line.** A record can outrun its line
 *    legitimately: Rust collapses a `use` path wrapped across several lines
 *    into one specifier. A range past the end of a line is out of spec, and
 *    clients differ on whether they drop such a diagnostic or clip it — a
