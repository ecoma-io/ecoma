/**
 * The workspace as the rule engine needs to see it: an Nx-shaped project graph,
 * and the `Workspace` object every analyzer resolves against.
 *
 * `evaluate(sites, graph, config)` is pure and takes a graph it does not build
 * (`../rules/README.md`). Under Nx that graph arrives from Nx. A language
 * server has no Nx — it is spawned by an editor, in a directory, with nothing
 * else — so this module builds the same shape from the same source of truth Nx
 * reads: the tracked `project.json` files.
 *
 * ## What it may assume about the tree, which is nothing
 *
 * No project name, no directory layout, no tag vocabulary (project CLAUDE.md —
 * the tool also runs over the private control-plane workspace through a pinned
 * harness clone). Everything below is derived: projects from the `project.json`
 * files that exist, node types from `projectType` by Nx's own rule, tags from
 * each project's own list, edges from the imports the analyzers actually find.
 *
 * ## Why the file list comes from git
 *
 * The analysis contract's `filesOf` means "the project's tracked files", and
 * git is the one component that already answers that exactly. The alternative
 * is a directory walk with a skip list — `node_modules`, `dist`, `target`,
 * `.venv` — which is a config nobody maintains until the day it swallows a real
 * source directory and the boundary quietly stops being enforced there
 * (Rule 14: derive before you configure). `--others --exclude-standard` adds
 * files that exist but are not committed yet, because a file a developer
 * created five seconds ago is exactly the one they are about to import.
 *
 * A workspace git cannot answer for is a LOUD failure, never a silent empty
 * index: `buildWorkspaceIndex` throws, and the server turns that into a
 * diagnostic on every open document rather than a clean bill of health.
