/**
 * One document in, the diagnostics an editor should show for it out.
 *
 * ## The single invariant this module exists to hold
 *
 * **An empty diagnostic list must mean "no violation", and nothing else.**
 *
 * An editor draws no marker for a file whose diagnostics are `[]`, and a
 * developer reads no marker as "checked, clean". So every way this pipeline can
 * fail to reach a verdict has to end in a diagnostic instead of in an empty
 * list: a config that will not load, a workspace index that cannot be built, a
 * language whose analyzer does not exist yet, an analyzer that threw, a rule
 * engine that threw, a parse failure the analyzer recorded as data.
 *
 * The return type is what makes that checkable rather than merely intended.
 * `analyzed` is `true` on exactly ONE path — the one where the analyzer
 * returned, the rule engine returned, AND the tree they were compared against
 * was read whole — and the caller is expected to refuse to publish an empty
 * list unless it is `true`. Two guards for one invariant is deliberate: this
 * module makes the promise, and `./server.mjs` verifies it before the bytes
 * leave the process.
 *
 * ## The third way to reach a wrong verdict, which is not a failure at all
 *
 * The two guards above watch a pipeline that ran. They cannot see a pipeline
 * that ran correctly over the wrong tree: a `project.json` the index could not
 * read takes its project out of the graph, an import into it then resolves as
 * an external package, the rule engine's npm branch returns before any tag
 * check runs, and every function on the path returns normally with nothing to
 * report. `analyzed: true` would be an honest answer from a pipeline handed bad
 * input, and it would publish `[]` over a real violation. So the input is
 * checked too: `indexGaps` reports what the index could not read, and while it
 * reports anything this module does not call a document analyzed.
 *
 * ## The one empty-and-clean case, stated so it is not mistaken for a hole
 *
 * A file whose extension no analyzer claims — `README.md`, `project.json`, an
 * `.svg` — returns `analyzed: true` with no diagnostics. That is the analysis
 * contract's own answer ("an unknown extension is a no-op, not an error"), and
 * it is a real verdict: a file with no imports this tool can see crosses no
 * boundary. The same is true of a file inside no project, which the rule engine
 * places outside the boundary system entirely.
