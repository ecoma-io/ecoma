/**
 * The index against a real tree: the file list really comes from git, the
 * manifests are really read, and the Go analyzer really resolves.
 *
 * The unit tier next door injects both, which is what lets it pin the index's
 * own decisions. What it cannot pin is whether the two real components exist
 * and agree — whether git answers at all, whether a `go.mod` two directories
 * down is reachable through `filesOf`. Only a tree on disk shows that.
