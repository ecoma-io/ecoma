 * Node built-ins, `typescript` and `vue/compiler-sfc` and nothing else, and the
 * base protocol is a fixed external contract of about forty lines. Adding a
 * third-party dependency for it would put a decision in this project that the

 * choice — the one class of literal Rule 14 allows to be written inline, and it
 * is written in exactly one place so no consumer restates it.
