/**
 * Reads the workspace's module-boundary law and refuses to run on a malformed
 * one.
 *
 * The law itself lives in `module-boundaries.config.mjs` at the workspace root,
 * where ESLint also reads it (that file's header says why it moved out of
 * `eslint.config.mjs`). This module is the second reader's side of that seam:
 * it loads the file and checks its shape, so a typo fails here, once, naming
 * the offending row — rather than downstream as a rule that silently matches
 * nothing. A constraint that matches nothing does not error; it approves.
 *
 * **The path is derived from the workspace root handed in, never from this
 * file's own location.** This tool runs in two trees: this repository, and the
 * private control-plane workspace that consumes it through a pinned reference
 * clone at `.harness/`. There the tool's own directory sits under `.harness/`
 * while the config it must read is at the consumer's root, so a
 * `../../../../` relative import would resolve to the harness's copy — the
 * wrong tree's rules, silently. Same reason nothing here assumes a project
 * name, an area, or a tag value: everything comes from the graph and the
 * config.
 *
 * Validation covers shape, and one thing beyond it: whether every pattern the
 * table contains can actually be used. Nx feeds tags, external-import globs and
 * `allow` entries to three different matchers, each of which builds a `RegExp`,
 * so an unbalanced bracket in a constraint row throws from inside a rule
 * halfway through a run — and an EMPTY entry throws nothing at all, it just
 * quietly matches nothing (or, in `allow`, everything). Both classes are caught
 * here by asking `./rules/match.mjs` — the same matchers the rules use, so the
 * check is the real one and not a second opinion about it. That is why a module
 * this low imports one from `./rules/`: the alternative is a second copy of the
 * matchers, which is the failure mode this whole file exists to prevent.
 *
 * What it still has no opinion on is the VALUES. Whether `layer:adapter` should
 * be allowed to reach `layer:domain` is the workspace's decision, stated in that
 * config with its reasoning; this module must not grow a view on it.
 *
 * The one shape here that upstream has no counterpart for is
 * `boundarySuppressions`: the exemptions a workspace has decided to accept, each
 * with the reason it was accepted. ESLint takes those as `eslint-disable`
 * comments, which is a JavaScript convention with no equivalent in Go, Rust or
 * Python and would give exemptions a second home besides the config this file
 * exists to keep single. Validation is where the mandatory reason is enforced,
 * loudly, at load — see `suppressionRowViolations`.
