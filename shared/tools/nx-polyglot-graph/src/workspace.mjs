/**
 * The tree a run judges: which projects exist, which files they own, and what
 * analyzing all of them produces.
 *
 * This is the layer neither `analysis/` nor `rules/` is allowed to be. An
 * analyzer is handed one file and never decides which files to visit
 * (`analysis/contract.md`); a rule is handed records and never reads a file
 * (`rules/README.md`). Somebody still has to answer both questions, and the
 * answer touches the filesystem and spawns processes — so it lives here, once,
 * behind injectable seams, rather than inside `../cli.mjs` where a spawned
 * subprocess is the only way to test it.
 *
 * **Projects and tags come from Nx, never from a walk of our own.** The graph
 * is the workspace's own answer to "what is a project and what is it tagged" —
 * derived from `project.json`, `nx.json` plugins (this one included) and
 * whatever inference Nx applies. A second reader of `project.json` files would
 * be a second answer, and the two would disagree exactly where a plugin
 * contributes an edge. Nx is spawned rather than imported for the same reason
 * the project imports no workspace code: `nx` is not on this project's import
 * list (project `CLAUDE.md`), and its own `nx graph --file=` is a stable
 * documented surface where its internal module layout is not.
 *
 * **Files come from git.** `nx graph --file=` emits no file map, and the
 * alternative — walking the tree — would need its own ignore rules that drift
 * from `.gitignore` the first time a build directory is added. `git ls-files`
 * is the same tracked-file set every resolver in this project already reasons
 * about ("Resolvers read tracked files only", project `CLAUDE.md`).
