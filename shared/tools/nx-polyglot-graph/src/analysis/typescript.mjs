/**
 * TypeScript/JavaScript analyzer — TypeScript's own parser and TypeScript's
 * own resolver, wired to the injected workspace. Nothing here reimplements
 * either.
 *
 * `ts.resolveModuleName` is a public API and already answers this question
 * correctly for an Nx workspace: `tsconfig.base.json` `paths`, secondary
 * entries, `exports` conditions, extension probing, and the
 * `isExternalLibraryImport` flag all come out of one call. Reimplementing any
 * of it would be a second answer to a question TypeScript already answers, and
 * the two would disagree exactly where a boundary rule needs them not to
 * (`contract.md`, "Resolution is delegated, never reimplemented").
 *
 * Known limits, deliberate and pinned by tests:
 *
 * - **`fileExists` is `readFile() !== null`.** `Workspace` exposes exactly one
 *   filesystem verb, and inventing a second would break the injected shape a
 *   test drives from memory, so an existence probe reads the file. Every read
 *   is memoised per workspace, which matters because TypeScript probes many
 *   candidate paths per specifier and hits the same ones over and over.
 * - **No `realpath`.** A package linked into `node_modules` — pnpm's workspace
 *   protocol — resolves to its link path, so it reports `external` instead of
 *   naming the project behind the link. This workspace wires its libs through
 *   `tsconfig.base.json` `paths` rather than workspace links, so the case does
 *   not arise here; a consumer workspace that used links would see the missing
 *   edge as an unattributed external, never as a wrong project.
 * - **`require(x)` and `require.resolve(x)` are read as imports** even when
 *   `require` is a local function of that name. Worst case is a spurious
 *   record naming a specifier the file really does contain — never a missed
 *   one. Those two callee forms are exactly the ones upstream's
 *   `getImportFromRequireCall` admits, and `isRequireCallee` below matches its
 *   shape node kind for node kind rather than widening it.
 *
 * ## One `kind` per import site, and how a mixed statement is judged
 *
 * The record carries one `kind` (`contract.md`), so a statement that is two
 * things at once has to be judged. Two rulings, both because `type-only` is a
 * statement about **runtime erasure** and rules turn constraints off on it:
 *
 * - `import { type A, B } from "x"` is `static`, not `type-only`. `B` survives
 *   to runtime, so the dependency is real. Only a statement where nothing
 *   survives — `import type`, or a named list whose every element carries
 *   `type` — is erased, and only then is it `type-only`.
 * - `export type { A } from "x"` is `type-only`, not `re-export`. It is both,
 *   and erasure is the property that decides which constraints apply at all; a
 *   barrel of types creates no runtime edge. Calling it `re-export` would
 *   apply runtime constraints to a statement that leaves no runtime behind.
