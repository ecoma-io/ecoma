/**
 * Import-site analysis: the dispatcher, and the types every language analyzer
 * in this directory returns.
 *
 * The reasoning behind each field — why a record is a superset of a graph
 * edge, why an intra-project import is still emitted, why a non-literal
 * `import()` resolves to null instead of being dropped — is in `contract.md`
 * beside this file. The types below are that document's machine-readable half;
 * neither is edited without the other.
 *
 * No analyzer is implemented yet. `analyzeFile` therefore throws for every
 * extension it recognises, by design: an empty result would read as "this file
 * imports nothing", which is indistinguishable from "clean" and is the exact
 * fake-green this repository refuses (root CLAUDE.md — scaffold openly, never
 * fake done). An extension it does NOT recognise is a different case and
 * returns the empty envelope — see `LANGUAGE_BY_EXTENSION`.
