/**
 * Go resolver — static analysis only, no `go` binary required (the same
 * property gonx gets from tree-sitter, achieved here with a comment mask and
 * two regexes over a format that `gofmt` keeps canonical for the whole
 * ecosystem).
 *
 * Model: one Go module per Nx project (`<projectRoot>/go.mod`); the module
 * path is the project's identity. An import of another project's module path
 * (exact or `<modulePath>/...`) is a static edge.
 *
 * **Comments are blanked before either regex runs** (`maskGoComments`). A
 * regex that cannot see a comment misreads ordinary, `gofmt`-clean Go in both
 * directions, and only one of those directions is survivable. A `)` written
 * inside a comment — `// TODO(alice): drop this once the port lands`, or the
 * note a blank import is expected to carry, `_ "github.com/lib/pq" // register
 * the driver (postgres)` — closes the `import (…)` block early, and every
 * import below it disappears: no graph edge, so `nx affected` stops rebuilding
 * dependents, and no import record, so the boundary check calls the file clean
 * while a violation sits in it. A checker that reports "clean" about a file it
 * failed to read is worse than no checker. The opposite direction — an import
 * written inside a block comment counted as one that is written — costs a
 * spurious edge, and the same mask removes it.
 *
 * Known parse limits, deliberate and pinned by tests. Each errs toward a
 * record naming text the file really contains, never toward a missed import,
 * and all but the first are shapes `gofmt` rewrites:
 *
 * - A **raw string literal** holding what looks like an import declaration at
 *   the start of one of its lines is read as that declaration. `gofmt` leaves
 *   such a file alone, so this is the one limit a formatted tree still meets.
 *   The mask keeps raw strings intact on purpose: an import path is itself a
 *   string literal, and a mask that ate string literals would have nothing
 *   left to read.
 * - `import` must open its line, after indentation only. `import "a"; import
 *   "b"` yields the first alone, and so does `import ("a"; "b")`; inside a
 *   block, each import needs its own line for the same reason.
 * - An import path spelled as a raw string rather than a quoted one is not
 *   read. Legal Go, which `gofmt` rewrites to the interpreted form.
 *
 * Two layers read those regexes. `resolveGoDependencies` reduces them to Nx
 * graph edges; `analyzeGo` returns the fuller import-site record
 * `analysis/contract.md` fixes — same parse, same limits, more of the answer
 * kept. `parseGoImportSites` is the single parse both go through, so the two
 * layers can never disagree about what a file imports.
 *
 * What the richer record adds, and what it deliberately leaves null:
 *
 * - `file` is always `null`. A Go import names a **package directory**, not a
 *   file, and which files that directory contributes is a build-constraint
 *   question needing the toolchain this resolver exists to avoid. That is the
 *   "resolution stops at a package rather than a file" case the contract
 *   allows, not a gap.
 * - `packageName` for an external import is the whole import path. Where a
 *   module path ends and a package path begins inside `example.com/a/b/c` is
 *   not statically knowable — only the module proxy knows — so the full path
 *   stands in, and a `bannedExternalImports` glob matches it the same way it
 *   would match a module prefix.
 * - `kind` is always `static`. Go has no dynamic import, no type-only import,
 *   and no re-export form; a blank (`_`) or dot (`.`) import is still an
 *   ordinary compile-time dependency.
 * - `spelling.path` is always `false`; `spelling.relative` is true exactly when
 *   the import resolved to the source file's own project. Go has no relative
 *   import form, so the second bit reads what an import REACHED rather than
 *   how it was written — `isOwnProjectImport` states why that is the honest
 *   answer for a language whose package graph cannot cycle.
