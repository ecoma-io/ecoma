/**
 * Vue SFC analyzer — the official SFC parser finds the `<script>` blocks, the
 * TypeScript analyzer next door reads the imports inside them.
 *
 * ## Positions are mapped by blanking, not by arithmetic
 *
 * A diagnostic that names the wrong line is worse than no diagnostic: it sends
 * a reader to code that is not the problem, and it does it silently. The
 * obvious implementation — analyze `block.content`, then add the block's start
 * line to every result — has an off-by-one at the first line of the block
 * (whose column is offset too, not just its line), and it needs a second,
 * different correction for a second `<script>` block.
 *
 * So no arithmetic happens at all. Each block is analyzed in a copy of the
 * WHOLE file with every character outside that block replaced by a space,
 * newlines kept. The text handed to TypeScript therefore has the block's code
 * at exactly the offsets, lines, and columns it occupies in the `.vue` file,
 * and every position TypeScript reports is already a `.vue` position. There is
 * nothing left to get wrong, and `@vue/compiler-sfc` guarantees the one fact
 * it relies on: `text.slice(block.loc.start.offset, block.loc.end.offset)` is
 * exactly `block.content`.
 *
 * The cost is one string copy per script block, which is bounded by the file.
 *
 * ## Why the parser is loaded lazily
 *
 * `vue/compiler-sfc` is a public entry point of `vue`, a workspace dependency,
 * and the SFC format is Vue's own — a hand-rolled `<script>` extractor would
 * be a second answer to a question its author already answers, and would be
 * wrong first on the cases that motivate a real parser (a `</script>` inside a
 * string, `<script>` and `<script setup>` together, a custom block).
 *
 * It is still loaded on first use rather than at import time, through
 * `createRequire`, for two reasons. This tool runs over trees that have no Vue
 * at all — the private control-plane workspace does not depend on it — and a
 * top-level import would make a missing `vue` break Go, Rust, and Python
 * analysis in a workspace that has no `.vue` file to analyze. And the contract
 * says an analyzer never throws: a missing parser becomes a failure record
 * naming what is absent, like any other thing this layer could not do.
