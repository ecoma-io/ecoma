/**
 * Rust resolver — reads Cargo manifests with a real TOML parser (smol-toml),
 * no `cargo` binary required.
 *
 * Model: one crate per Nx project (`<projectRoot>/Cargo.toml`). Edges come
 * from dependency entries that resolve to another project's directory:
 *   - `{ path = "…" }` entries, relative to the declaring manifest;
 *   - `{ workspace = true }` entries, resolved through the nearest ancestor
 *     manifest carrying `[workspace]` (its `[workspace.dependencies]` entry
 *     must itself be a `path` dependency to point at a project).
 * Registry (crates.io) dependencies are ignored — external nodes are out of
 * scope for this plugin; only project↔project edges matter to `nx affected`.
 *
 * ## Source level, alongside the manifests
 *
 * `analyzeRust` reads `.rs` sources for what the manifests cannot show: WHICH
 * file reaches another crate, on which line, through which path. A Cargo
 * manifest says a crate may be used; it never says a boundary was crossed, and
 * `Cargo.toml:1` is not a location a reader can act on.
 *
 * The crate a `use` names is the **import** name, which is not always the
 * package name. Two spellings have to be reconciled, and this workspace
 * contains both: Cargo replaces `-` with `_` for the identifier (`engine-core`
 * is `use engine_core::…`), and a `[lib] name` overrides the package name
 * outright (`rba-desktop` declares `[lib] name = "rba_desktop_lib"`, so the
 * only spelling any source can use is that one). Both sides are normalised to
 * underscores before matching, and `[lib] name` wins when it is present.
 *
 * Known parse limits, deliberate and pinned by tests. The worst case of each
 * is a spurious record naming text the file really contains — never a missed
 * project, which is the standard the Go header sets:
 *
 * - **`use` is matched at the start of a line** (after optional indentation
 *   and an optional `pub`/`pub(crate)`), read to the first `;`. A `use` inside
 *   a raw string literal that starts its own line would be read; a `use`
 *   preceded on the same line by an attribute or another statement would not.
 *   `rustfmt` produces neither.
 * - **A `use` whose path opens with a brace group** — `use {a::b, c::d};` —
 *   names no crate before the group. It is recorded with `resolved: null` and
 *   a failure, because guessing which of the group's arms was meant is exactly
 *   the guessing the contract forbids; the record is never dropped.
 * - **Uniform paths are ambiguous and resolved toward the crate.** Since Rust
 *   2018, `use foo::Bar` can name either an extern crate `foo` or a local
 *   `mod foo`. A first segment matching another project's crate name is read
 *   as that crate. A local module deliberately named after a sibling crate
 *   would produce a spurious record.
 * - **A renamed dependency is not followed.** `dep = { package = "real" }`
 *   makes the source spell `dep` while the crate is `real`; the manifest
 *   resolver above still draws that edge, so the dependency is never lost —
 *   only its source-level location is.
 * - **`mod` is not an import.** A `mod` declaration names a file inside the
 *   same crate, so it crosses no project boundary and is never recorded.

 * resolver this file exists without. Matching only against crate names the
 * workspace actually declares is what makes the form decidable: the crossing
