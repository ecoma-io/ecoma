/**
 * The terminal report: violations as lines a developer can act on without
 * opening anything else.
 *
 * The first line of every entry is `file:line:column`, unindented and with no
 * prefix, because that is the shape a terminal turns into a link and an editor
 * turns into a jump — it is also why the analysis record carries 1-based
 * positions at all (`../analysis/contract.md`). Everything after it is
 * indented, so a `grep` for `:` down the left margin lists exactly the sites.
 *
 * Four things are printed per violation and each has a reader in mind: the
 * `messageId` (the same id ESLint would report, so a search finds upstream's
 * documentation and a differential comparison has something to compare), the
 * rendered message (what is wrong), the import and the project pair (which
 * edge), and the constraint row that fired (WHY it is wrong — a message saying
 * a project "can only depend on libs tagged with X" does not say which line of
 * `module-boundaries.config.mjs` said so, and that is the line a fix has to
 * agree with).
 *
 * This module decides nothing. A formatter that filtered would be a rule
 * wearing a formatter's name, and it would disagree with the engine the first
 * time either changed (`README.md` beside this file).

 *
 * A WHOLE-FILE failure is a hole: nothing was read, parsed, or analyzed, so
 * this file contributed no verdict at all. The summary line above still counts
 * imports and files, so a reader who sees "no boundary violations" is being
 * told about coverage; a file in this section is coverage that is missing.
