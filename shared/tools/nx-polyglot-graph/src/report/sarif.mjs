/**
 * SARIF 2.1.0 — the machine-readable half of the report, written for GitHub's
 * `upload-sarif`. No schema validator is installed in this workspace; what
 * `sarif.integration.test.mjs` pins is the subset of the 2.1.0 schema a
 * rejected upload turns on. A file GitHub silently rejects is worse than no
 * file at all: the job stays green, the annotations never appear, and nothing
 * says why.
 *
 * Four fields carry the whole value and each is easy to get subtly wrong:
 *
 * - **`ruleId` is upstream's `messageId`, spelled exactly.** That is the same
 *   contract `../rules/messages.mjs` keeps for the text: two tools that both
 *   say "error" agree on nothing until they name the same rule, and a
 *   differential comparison against `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` has nothing
 *   to compare otherwise. The rule catalogue is DERIVED from that module's
 *   message table (Rule 14), so a rule added upstream cannot be missing here.
 * - **`artifactLocation.uri` is workspace-relative**, which is what GitHub
 *   resolves an annotation against. The analysis contract already produces
 *   workspace-relative paths, so this module only has to not break one — it
 *   percent-encodes per segment, because a path containing a space or a `#` is
 *   not a valid URI reference and the whole run is rejected for one file.
 * - **`region` is 1-based** in both axes, matching the analysis records; SARIF
 *   agrees, so nothing is converted. `columnKind` is stated rather than left to
 *   the default because the analyzers made a real choice — columns count UTF-16
 *   code units (`../analysis/source-util.mjs`) — and a consumer that assumed
 *   code points would land in the wrong column on any line with an emoji.
 * - **`level` is `error`** on every result. This report exists to block a
 *   merge; a warning would render as an annotation nobody has to act on.
 *
 * Analysis failures are NOT results. A file this tool could not parse is a
 * place it has no verdict about, and filing it as a finding would put a
 * boundary alert on code that may well be clean. They travel as
 * `invocations[].toolExecutionNotifications`, which is SARIF's own slot for
 * "the tool had trouble here", at `warning` — `executionSuccessful` stays true
 * because the run did complete.
 *
 * No `version`/`semanticVersion` on the driver: libraries in this workspace are
 * internal and unversioned (root `CLAUDE.md`), so there is no honest number to
 * put there and `0.0.0` would only look like one.
