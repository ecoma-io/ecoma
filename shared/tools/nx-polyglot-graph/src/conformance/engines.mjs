/**
 * The two engines, driven over one fixture tree.
 *
 * `runUpstream` runs the real `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` through ESLint's
 * programmatic API. `runEngine` runs this project's `src/analysis` +
 * `src/rules` over the same files, the same graph and the same options. Nothing
 * is stubbed on either side: the point of the comparison is that both answers
 * come from the code that would run in production.
 *
 * ## Everything in this file is test-only, and the shipped code must stay clear of it
 *
 * `eslint`, `@nx/eslint-plugin` and `typescript-eslint` are imported HERE and
 * nowhere else in the project. The tool itself may import Node built-ins,
 * `typescript` and `vue/compiler-sfc` only (project `CLAUDE.md`), and the
 * `src/rules/` layer's whole value is being pure — importing the plugin would
 * drag `@nx/devkit` and a project-graph read into it. `boundary.test.mjs` is the
 * check that no shipped module ever reaches this directory.
 *
 * ## How upstream is made to judge a fixture instead of this repository
 *
 * The rule reads its workspace through four `globalThis` slots that
 * `readProjectGraph` fills from Nx's on-disk cache. It only fills them when
 * `isTerminalRun()` is false, so setting them AND making that predicate true is
 * what hands upstream the fixture's graph rather than this repository's. The
 * predicate reads `process.argv[1]`; it is pointed at an eslint-shaped path for
 * the duration of a lint and restored afterwards. Both moves are upstream's own
 * documented reuse path (`ensureGlobalProjectGraph`), not a patch of its
 * behaviour — no rule logic is replaced, and the rule cannot tell the
 * difference.
