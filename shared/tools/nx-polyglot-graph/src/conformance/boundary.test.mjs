 * The constraint that lets this directory exist at all, made checkable — and

 *
 * `src/conformance/` imports ESLint and `@nx/eslint-plugin` on purpose — a
 * differential test that stubbed the thing it compares against would prove
 * nothing. The shipped tool must not, and the reason is not tidiness: the whole
 * value of `src/rules/` is being pure over records, and importing the plugin
 * would pull `@nx/devkit` and a project-graph read into it. Self-containment is
 * the other half: a project that imports a sibling cannot be extracted, and it
 * cannot run inside the private control-plane workspace, which is where this
 * tool also has to work.
 *
 * `SHIPPED_PACKAGES` below is the single home of what the tool may depend on.
 * It was prose in the project's `CLAUDE.md` before, and prose drifted: the list
 * there named three entries while the tree used five. A list nothing reads is a
 * list nobody updates, so `CLAUDE.md` now states the rule and points here.
 *
 * The file list is derived by walking the project rather than written down, so
 * a module added tomorrow is covered without anyone remembering to add it.
