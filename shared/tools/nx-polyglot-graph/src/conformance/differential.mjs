/**
 * Putting the two verdicts side by side, and naming the direction of every
 * disagreement.
 *
 * Three outcomes per reported violation, and they are not symmetric:
 *
 * - **agree** — both engines report the same `messageId` at the same site.
 * - **this-tool-stricter** — this engine reports where ESLint is silent. A
 *   DECISION, legitimate only when the case declares it and says why; never
 *   tolerated silently.
 * - **this-tool-weaker** — ESLint reports where this engine is silent. A
 *   DEFECT, always. It is the false negative the whole tool exists to remove:
 *   a green light nobody can trust is worse than the silence this replaces,
 *   because silence about Go, Rust and Python is at least known.
 *
 * ## What "the same site" means
 *
 * ESLint reports the whole statement — `import { a } from "@x/y";` starts at
 * column 1 — while this engine reports the SPECIFIER, because an editor
 * diagnostic should underline the string that is wrong. Comparing columns for
 * equality would therefore mark every single pair as a disagreement about
 * nothing. Instead a pair matches when this engine's position falls INSIDE the
 * range ESLint reported, which is the strongest statement that survives the
 * difference: same file, same statement, same rule. A violation this engine
 * reports at a different statement stays unmatched, and so surfaces as one
 * stricter plus one weaker rather than being quietly absorbed.
 *
 * ## The axis that does not need ESLint at all
 *
 * Everything above is a diff, and a diff needs a counterparty. ESLint has no
 * parser for `.go`, `.rs` or `.py`, so `weaker` is EMPTY BY CONSTRUCTION for
 * those three — not measured and found to be zero, but unmeasurable. What is
 * left for them is each probe's hand-written `tool: [...]`, which can only
 * catch a regression on a fixture shape somebody already thought to write.
 *
 * So a second axis, which compares this engine against ITSELF:
 * **`spelling`**. Probes carrying the same `spelling` key write one and the
 * same import in different ways — `use a::b;` and `use a::{b};`, a package at
 * `src/pkg` and the same package under a declared `package-dir` — and the
 * suite requires them to produce the identical verdict. No expectation has to
 * be right for that to bite: a spelling the analyzer silently drops disagrees
 * with its siblings even when someone wrote the wrong `tool: [...]` down for
 * it and the declaration check went green.
 *
 * `measuredScope` is the same honesty applied to the diff itself — which
 * probes upstream could read at all, as data, so "zero weaker rows" can be
 * read as the JS/TS/Vue measurement it is.
