/**
 * Every number `README.md` states about this catalogue, held to the catalogue.
 *
 * The ledger beside this file is the document a reader consults before trusting
 * `src/rules/`, and its numbers are the part that rots first: they are written
 * by hand, they change whenever a case is added, and nothing about a stale one
 * looks wrong. One of them survived three edits of the header it was derived
 * from and ended up matching no reading of the catalogue at all.
 *
 * So the numbers are derived here and compared, rather than remembered. A count
 * that stops matching fails this test instead of misleading someone, which is
 * the arrangement Rule 14 asks for when a value cannot live in exactly one
 * place: the prose keeps its number, and a gate keeps the prose honest.
 *
 * `statedNumber` throws when the sentence it reads has moved, rather than
 * finding nothing and passing. A guard that silently stops guarding is worse
 * than no guard, because the README then looks checked.
