/**
 * The conformance catalogue: one minimal Nx-shaped workspace per behaviour,
 * built to make `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` say something specific — and,
 * beside each one, the near-miss that must make it say nothing.
 *
 * ## Why every positive has a negative
 *
 * A suite of positives proves a reimplementation can be loud. It cannot
 * distinguish an engine that reproduces upstream's semantics from one that
 * reports on everything, and the reimplementation failures that matter are all
 * on the boundary: a glob that anchors where upstream's does not, an `every()`
 * whose empty case inverts, a constraint list read as OR instead of AND. So the
 * near-miss is the load-bearing half. It sits in the same case as its positive
 * whenever the two share a tree, because a reader deciding whether to trust a
 * rule wants both answers in one place.
 *
 * ## What a case declares, and why it declares its own answer
 *
 * Each probe states the message ids ESLint MUST report. Without that a case
 * that quietly stopped triggering its rule would still "agree" — both engines
 * silent, comparison green, nothing proven. Where the two engines are meant to
 * differ the probe also states this engine's own verdict plus the reason; a
 * verdict without a reason is rejected, because a deliberate difference from
 * ESLint is a decision and decisions get written down.
 *
 * ## What may not appear here
 *
 * No project name, tag value or area from any real workspace. This tool runs
 * over two trees — this repository and the private control-plane workspace —
 * and a fixture that assumed either one's vocabulary would be testing a
 * coincidence (project `CLAUDE.md`). Tags below are invented per case and mean
 * nothing outside it.
