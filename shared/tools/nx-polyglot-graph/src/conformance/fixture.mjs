/**
 * The fixture workspaces the differential runs over — one Nx-shaped tree per
 * case, all inside a single throwaway root.
 *
 * ## Why one root and not one per case
 *
 * `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` reads the workspace root through
 * `@nx/devkit`'s `workspaceRoot`, which is a module-level constant evaluated the
 * first time nx is loaded in a process. It cannot be changed afterwards, so a
 * process can serve exactly one workspace root. Every case therefore lives in
 * its own directory UNDER one root, and the whole differential runs in one
 * process instead of one process per case.
 *
 * Two consequences the case catalogue has to respect, both asserted here rather
 * than trusted: import aliases and fake package names are workspace-wide, so
 * they must be globally unique; project names are per-case (each case gets its
 * own graph) and only have to be unique within their case.
 *
 * ## Why the tree is on disk at all
 *
 * Upstream reads files this layer cannot hand it: a project's `package.json`
 * `exports` for entry points, `module-federation.config.js` for the MFE
 * exemption, the root and project `package.json` for `banTransitiveDependencies`,
 * and `tsconfig.base.json` for resolution. A fixture that only existed as a
 * graph object would exercise this engine and stub upstream, which is the
 * opposite of a differential test. So the tree is real, both engines read the
 * same bytes, and the graph object is the only thing handed to both.
 *
 * The root is a `mkdtemp` directory under the OS temp dir and nothing is ever
 * written inside the repository — the same containment `dev-cli`'s git fixtures
 * use, and the reason the workspace's own lint, typecheck and build cannot
 * reach a fixture: there is nothing to reach until a test creates it.
